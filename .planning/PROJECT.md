# Saymo

## What This Is

Saymo is a fully local macOS voice assistant that listens to live calls,
detects when the user is addressed, and speaks into the meeting through a
virtual microphone using the user's cloned voice. It is for a user who wants a
local, controllable assistant for standups, Q&A, and takeover moments without
cloud voice APIs.

## Core Value

Saymo must reliably catch when the user is expected to answer and respond fast
enough that the call still feels live.

## Current Milestone: v1.1 Call Intelligence Loop

**Goal:** Make saved call samples and live-call probes smart enough to explain
who spoke, why Saymo would answer, and where provider-specific latency is spent.

**Status:** Completed on 2026-05-18.

**Target features:**
- Speaker-aware samples: captured windows can carry local speaker labels and
  evaluations can separate "me", "other", and "unknown" speakers.
- Local trigger classifier: accepted/rejected samples can train a lightweight
  local classifier that runs in shadow mode before it affects auto-mode.
- Provider latency probe: active Chrome call providers can report segmented
  end-to-end latency for unmute, playback start, and mute recovery.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Local voice playback into calls through BlackHole routing exists before
  this milestone.
- ✓ Manual hotkeys and takeover checks exist before this milestone.
- ✓ `saymo trigger-capture` can save classified call windows as WAV plus JSON
  metadata before this milestone.
- ✓ Faster catch path is measurable and tunable per profile.
- ✓ Faster say path is preflighted and measured before calls.
- ✓ Captured trigger samples feed a repeatable tuning/evaluation workflow.
- ✓ v1.0 Speedly Catcher + Speedly Sayer completed and merged on 2026-05-15.
- ✓ Captured trigger samples can carry local speaker labels and evaluation
  groups results by `me`, `other`, and `unknown`.
- ✓ Accepted/rejected sample labels can train a local classifier that runs in
  shadow mode for `trigger-eval` and `trigger-check`.
- ✓ Active-call provider probes can report segmented latency and export local
  JSON/Markdown history by profile/provider.

### Out of Scope

- Cloud STT/TTS as a required path — the product remains local-by-default.
- Full autonomous meeting participation — Saymo assists with prepared answers
  and addressed questions, but manual takeover remains supported.
- Training a new voice model from call recordings in this milestone — captured
  call audio is for trigger and routing behavior, not voice-clone training.
- Required automatic diarization model installation — v1.1 accepts local
  speaker-label sidecars and keeps diarization engines optional.

## Context

- Current stack: Python CLI, Click commands, faster-whisper, Ollama, local TTS
  engines, BlackHole routing, and Chrome provider automation.
- Live-call risk areas are latency, false positives when a name is merely
  mentioned, missed trigger variants from Whisper, and manual recovery when the
  user wants to answer themselves.
- Recent work added trigger diagnostics, fuzzy trigger learning, manual
  takeover hotkeys, trigger confirmation, response cache routing diagnostics,
  and classified trigger sample capture.

## Constraints

- **Platform:** macOS with BlackHole and Chrome-based call providers — existing
  routing model and provider abstractions should stay intact.
- **Privacy:** Captured samples and metadata stay local under `~/.saymo/`; real
  config and recordings must not be committed.
- **Latency:** Optimizations must preserve answer gating quality; faster false
  positives are worse than slower correct skips.
- **Configurability:** Profile-specific knobs belong in `config.yaml` or
  documented CLI flags, not hardcoded private names.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Keep live-call listening local-first | Avoid leaking meeting audio and preserve offline operation | ✓ Good |
| Use classified trigger samples before deeper ML changes | Real misses/false positives are the best tuning data | ✓ Implemented via `trigger-eval` |
| Separate catch latency from say latency | Different bottlenecks require different measurements and tests | ✓ Implemented in `saymo auto` diagnostics |
| Use speaker labels as sidecars first | Avoid forcing a diarization dependency while still enabling speaker-aware evaluation | ✓ Implemented in Phase 5 |
| Run classifier in shadow mode before enabling it | Protect live calls from unproven learned behavior | ✓ Implemented in Phase 6 |
| Measure providers through the existing abstraction | Keep provider latency work scoped to Chrome call automation, not UI redesign | ✓ Implemented in Phase 7 |
